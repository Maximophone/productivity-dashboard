Okay here is the idea with this I work in Obsidian every day I create a daily note and in this daily note I track a number of things like the number of hours I've worked, also track procrastination and dispersion (procrastination being when I go out for lunch, basically when I do whatever work-related things and dispersion being when I deviate from my initial plan and I start doing things that I had not planned). I also track the time of meditation I do per day, the quality of my meditation, I track what else a number of things.

The first task will be to explore my Obsidian daily notes a little bit to get an idea of all the stuff that I track. Then the goal will be to basically set up a dashboard that I can consult that shows me how my productivity is fluctuating on a daily basis and also on a weekly basis. I have to think a little bit about what kind of things I want to monitor. One important detail is that the daily notes are written in plain text and there may not be any clear pattern of how I've been tracking things. So we will need to run them through an AI to extract and structure all the information that we want to gather for this. We should use a cheap AI. I'm thinking Gemini 3 Flash is probably the cheapest option that still gets us a very decent result. There's a question about how this runs exactly. I feel like it should be a web app and whenever we start to web it up, it should detect and process the daily notes that have not been processed yet and then serve it. Maybe whenever someone accesses someone refreshes the page, this script can run in this thing that processes the new notes can run in the background. What else? I guess that captures the rough idea. 

Oh I guess there are open questions about how the data should be saved. I guess it should have a simple database like SQLite. We should make it so that we can easily modify it though going forward, like add or remove metrics etc. I don't want to do premature optimization. Yeah maybe the code is structured in a simple way that makes it easy to edit going forward or yeah we have to think about this a little bit. But if I were to summarize:
1. We should explore my notes
2. Think together about what kind of metrics I want to track and what kind of visualizations we want to provide
3. Start building everything
